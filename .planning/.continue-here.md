<current_state>

Project initialization is 90% complete. The roadmapper just finished creating ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, and updating REQUIREMENTS.md traceability. These files need to be committed after user approval.

We were about to present the roadmap summary for user approval.

</current_state>

<completed_work>

- PROJECT.md created and committed
- config.json created and committed (mode: interactive, depth: standard, parallelization: true)
- Research completed (4 parallel agents: stack, features, architecture, pitfalls)
- SUMMARY.md synthesized and committed
- REQUIREMENTS.md created and committed (16 v1 requirements)
- Roadmap created by gsd-roadmapper (7 phases, 100% coverage)

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

1. Present roadmap to user for approval (show the 7-phase structure)
2. User approves or requests adjustments
3. Commit ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, updated REQUIREMENTS.md
4. Display "PROJECT INITIALIZED" completion banner
5. Show next steps (/gsd:discuss-phase 1 or /gsd:plan-phase 1)

</remaining_work>

<uncommitted_files>

- .planning/ROADMAP.md (new)
- .planning/STATE.md (new)

The project is "Am I Better Than Yesterday?" — an AI-driven personal growth app. This milestone focuses on the backend AI evaluation pipeline. The existing codebase has FastAPI, auth, journals, goals, and database models. We're building the AI components: voice transcription, scoring, extraction, verdicts, and notifications.

Key decisions from research:
- Deterministic-first scoring (LLM inconsistency ~40%)
- Mood classification before delivering emotional verdicts (safety)
- Voice as independent Phase 1 (no dependencies)

User philosophy: "Supportive but with edge" — celebrate wins, poke egos on slips.
